						<h2>What is Google Analytics?</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Google Analytics is a web analytics service that provides statistics and basic analytical tools 
							for search engine optimization (SEO) and marketing purposes.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							The service is part of the Google Marketing Platform and is available for free to anyone with a 
							Google account.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							This statistics includes how many people visit your site,
							how they access your site, and what they do when they land on it.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							It also provides insight into who these visitors are. For example, where they are from, 
							the language they speak, and demographic information such as their age range and gender.
						</p>
					</section>

						<h3>The above information is useful for several reasons:</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Knowing how people visit your site shows you which marketing methods are most effective.</h4>
						<aside class="notes">

						<h2>How does Google Analytics work?</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Google Analytics acquires user data from each website visitor through the use of page tags. 
							A JavaScript page tag is inserted into the code of each page. 
							This tag runs in the web browser of each visitor, collecting data and sending it 
							to one of Google's data collection servers. Google Analytics can then generate customizable reports 
							to track and visualize data such as the number of users, bounce rates, average session durations,
							sessions by channel, page views, goal completions and more.

						<h2>Features</h2>

						<h2>Important metrics</h2>
						<aside class="notes">

							businesses than others, these are some of the most popular metrics:
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Realtime</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							The real-time section lets you monitor visitor activity as it happens. 
							You can see information such as where visitors are being referred to your website from,
							the pages people are currently viewing, and the countries people are located in.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Audience</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							The remaining reports are used to view historical trends. You can choose the date range you want 
							to view by clicking on the calendar in the top right corner.
							The audience section provides information about the people who have accessed your site.
							This includes the number of visitors, the percentage of returning users, and how many pages
							a person visits.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="./images/aduience.png" alt="aduience">
						<aside class="notes">You can also see basic information about the users, such as where they are from, 
							their language, and the operating system they use.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Acquisition</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							The acquisition section shows you how people are coming to your site.  You can see which acquisition 
							channels—search engines, social media, referrals or paid ads—are effective. You can also see how 
							visitors acquired from different platforms act on your site.
						</aside>

							It can also help you spot opportunities for further growth.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Behaviour</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							The behaviour tab shows you how people act when they visit your site. 
							It shows you which pages are most popular in the chosen time frame, as well as information about 
							how long users spend on each page.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="./images/behaviour.png" alt="aduience">
						<aside class="notes">
							A particularly useful feature here is the behaviour flow tool (above) which illustrates 
							how users navigate your site. If you want people to take certain steps when they visit your site; 
							for example, clicking from a blog post to an eBook signup form, this section will show you if your 
							website is doing so effectively.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Conversions</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							The final tab is the conversions tab which lets you see how your website is performing 
							in relation to specific goals.

							You can set a variety of goals within Google Analytics. 
							These include when users visit a specific page, when they spend a certain amount of time on your site,
							when they visit multiple pages, or when they perform an action.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<img src="./images/conversions.png" alt="aduience">

			<h2>How to Use Google Analytics?</h2>
			<aside class="notes">
				Google has made it very easy to get set up with Google Analytics. Here are the steps you need to take.
			</aside>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>1. Sign up for Google Analytics</h3>
			<aside class="notes">
				You need a Google account to sign into Analytics. Once you have an account, head over to the 
				Google Analytics homepage and click “Start measuring.” When setting up Analytics, you need to choose 
				an account name, select your data sharing settings, and then specify whether you want 
				to measure a website, an app, or both.
			</aside>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>2. Add the Google Analytics Tracking ID to Your Website</h3>
			<aside class="notes">
				Once you have created your account, Google will provide you with a tracking ID.
				You need to add this ID to each of the pages on your site that you want to track.							
				While this can be complicated, most CMS systems and web builders make it easy to do.
				If you use WordPress, you can use a free tool like Yoast to automatically add the tracking information.
				Meanwhile, Shopify, Squarespace, and Wix all have built-in integrations that make it easy 
				to add code to a website.
			</aside>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>3. Add Users to Google Analytics</h3>
			<aside class="notes">
				Once you have Google Analytics set up you can invite other people to access the account by heading 
				to Adminà Account User Management and then clicking the plus sign.
				When adding a user, you can choose the exact permissions you want to give them.
				You can also remove people from your Google Analytics account if you want to revoke access.
